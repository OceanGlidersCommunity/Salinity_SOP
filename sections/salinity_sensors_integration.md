# Sensors and integrations

## CTD Sensors
On gliders, currently three types of CTD-sensors are in use (see Table 1). 
CT sensors can be unpumped (sections 2.1.1; 2.2) or pumped (section 2.1.2). 
Unpumped CT sensors have lower power consumption requirements as well as reduced susceptibility to blockages/failures because of the larger throughflow pipe (section 6.3.4). 
There is also reduced background vibration and noise, which is advantageous when measuring microstructure (reference to microstructure SOP in future). 
However, the disadvantage of the unpumped sensors is in the post processing correction for the effects of thermal-inertia because the flow rate through the inlet is not known and has to be estimated from the gliderâ€™s flight model (section 7). 
Pumped CT sensors on the other hand, have a constant through-flow rate, allowing for a simpler correction of thermal-inertia. Nevertheless, both pumped and unpumped sensors require corrections for thermal-inertia (section 7). 

### Seabird
Conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensors distributed by sea-bird electronics is currently the most widely used sensor on gliders.
