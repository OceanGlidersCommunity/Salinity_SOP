# Missions execution

This section covers the activities of those deploying and recovering the gliders in the field in addition to best practices for glider pilots.

## Deployment
The deployment procedure of gliders is platform specific and the manufacturer guidelines should be followed. 
Commonly, gliders are deployed from large ships or small boats. 
Recently, gliders have been deployed from an AutoNaut (UEA). 
If sensor caps are required, these should be removed before the glider enters the water.

## Colocated CTD profiles for post-mission sensor correction
On deployment and recovery of the glider, an in situ comparison-CTD cast should be completed. 
On a ship, the CTD rosette is often accompanied by salinometry that is used to calibrate the ship CTD (ref). 
If the glider is deployed from a small boat, a smaller hand deployable CTD can be used.
In the case that a CTD cast cannot be completed at the same time as deployment, the characteristics of deep water masses (below the thermocline and depending on the region of deployment) can be compared with high quality reference CTD profiles (shipborne CTD, mooring data or delayed-mode Argo float data). 
Those reference data should be found in the same regional basin with respect to the local circulation pattern. 
Ideally and when possible, profiles from the offshore area where water mass variability is smaller should be used.

## Piloting
In this section specific piloting requirements during the mission execution are mentioned which are needed to allow quality control.

### Flight model calibration dives
Upon deployment it is important to perform a number of calibration dives (follow steps outlined Depth Averaged Currents (DAC) SOP to constrain the flight model).
