# Missions execution

This section covers the activities of those deploying and recovering the gliders in the field in addition to best practices for glider pilots.

## Deployment
The deployment procedure of gliders is platform specific and the manufacturer guidelines should be followed. 
Commonly, gliders are deployed from large ships or small boats. 
Recently, gliders have been deployed from an AutoNaut (UEA). 
If sensor caps are required, these should be removed before the glider enters the water.
