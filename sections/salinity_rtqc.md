This chapter has to be co-developed with the OceanGlidesr Data Management Task Team, the Data Assembly Centers (DACs) and Gui's (@castelao) RTQC group or links provided to existing documents etc (to be discussed).

## Required Metadata and Real Time Data Processing

- send OceanGliders metadata and set up real time data flow
- coefficients from pre-deployment calibration (section XXX) should be applied as soon as possible to ensure best available data is send to real-time data centers
