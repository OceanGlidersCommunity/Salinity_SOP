	abstract = {Abstract We have examined the magnitude and relaxation time of the thermal anomaly of the fluid flowing through the conductivity cell manufactured by Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) that is induced by the heat stored in the wall of this cell using oceanic data collected in a thermohaline staircase. The relaxation is 9 to 10 s, about twice the value predicted by Lueck, while the initial magnitude of the conductivity error is 2.8\%, about 35\% smaller than predicted. The error in the measured conductivity is significant and long-lived and results in density errors detectable for 45 s after the sensor enters an isopycnal layer. An efficient numerical algorithm removes the anomaly from the measured conductivity signal and clears the resulting error from the computed salinity and density.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn this work a new methodology is proposed to correct the thermal lag error in data from unpumped CTD sensors installed on Slocum gliders. The advantage of the new approach is twofold: first, it takes into account the variable speed of the glider; and second, it can be applied to CTD profiles from an autonomous platform either with or without a reference cast. The proposed methodology finds values for four correction parameters that minimize the area between two temperature–salinity curves given by two CTD profiles. A field experiment with a Slocum glider and a standard CTD was conducted to test the method. Thermal lag–induced salinity error of about 0.3 psu was found and successfully corrected.},

Three SBE-41CP CTDs mounted on prototype ice-tethered profilers deployed in the Arctic Ocean sampled diffusive thermohaline staircases and telemetered data to shore at their full 1-Hz resolution. Estimations of and corrections for finite thermistor time response, time shifts between when a parcel of water was sampled by the thermistor and when it was sampled by the conductivity cell, and the errors in salinity induced by the thermal inertia of the conductivity cell are developed with these data. In addition, thousands of profiles from Argo profiling floats equipped with SBE-41 CTDs were screened to select examples where thermally well-mixed surface layers overlaid strong thermoclines for which standard processing often yields spuriously fresh salinity estimates. Hundreds of profiles so identified are used to estimate and correct for the conductivity cell thermal mass error in SBE-41 CTDs.},
