# OceanGliders Salinity SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Salinity_SOP) is for the [OceanGliders](https://www.oceangliders.org) Salinity Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Read the SOP [here](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/Salinity_SOP/README.html). 

Everyone is welcome to join the SOP at any time.

## Community review
The community review is open from November 2021 to April 30 2022.

### Who is invited to review?
Constructive feedback by anyone is welcome. We encourage both experts and new gliders users who want to start observing oxygen to feedback on the document. For example: Experts are welcome to critically assess the specific methods and uncertainty ranges outlined in the SOP. New users can help to improve the SOP by providing a feedback from the user perspective. Please [let us know that you use the SOP](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Salinity_SOP/discussions).

### How to contribute

## Next steps
1) 4 months community review on GitHub starting in November 2021 until February 28 2022
2) Follow the requirements for the [GOOS](https://www.goosocean.org) endorsement process as outline in [Hermes 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.25607/OBP-926)
3) Depositing of first major SOP release at the [Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS)](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org) + doi by OBPS.
4) Submission of shorter version to [Frontiers: Research Topic Best Practices in Ocean Observing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7173/best-practices-in-ocean-observing) for peer-review March 2022

The main SOP document will always reside in this GitHub repository to allow updates within the OceanGliders community at any time. 
After major revisions regular peer-reviewed updates are planned.
